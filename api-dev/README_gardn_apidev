A minimal docker containerised API

bare_app.py -  This one is completely simple, for the purpose of getting the docker side of things up and running.
app.py - This one uses more dependencies.

# Run the app in your local environment

1. Set up environment variables:
source setup.sh

2. Check config settings in YAML file:
app/config.yml

3. Build and run using the Dockerfile:
Base - miniconda
environment.yml

# Running fastapi at the command line

uvicorn app:app --reload --port 80
uvicorn app:app --reload --port 80 --host 0.0.0.0

Because we're running on conda we need to activate the environment
every time. It's suboptimal, but this way we get integrated
scientific packages.

# Earth engine notes: credentials
How to get ee credentials into the docker image? 
Copy the service account file - be very careful with this, the keyfile is like
your password. Keep track of copies, monitor usage and rotate frequently.

gcloud iam service-accounts keys create $KEY --iam-account $SERVICE_ACCOUNT

# python/conda enviro setup

First time:
mkdir data
setup_conda.sh
conda activate apidev 

# Running docker api on cloudrun
1. Pick an existing project
2. ...

# Restful

Installation instructions:
https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/python_install-conda#install_api

The Earth Engine Python API is distributed as a conda-forge package at: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/earthengine-api. It is installed with the conda install command.
Recommended to make a special purpose conda env.
https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/python_install-conda#install_api

Alternative: to sign into Earth Engine:
earthengine authenticate

Upon entering the authorization code, an authorization token gets saved to a credentials file which can be found below. 
Subsequent use of the API's ee.Initialize() command and the earthengine command line tool will look to 
this file to authenticate. If you want to revoke authorization, simply delete the credentials file.

ls $HOME/.config/earthengine/credentials

conda update -c conda-forge earthengine-api
